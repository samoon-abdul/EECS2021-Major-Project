# Major Project AVR programming - Regenerative Motor Braking

Major Project for EECS2021. Uses C, Icarus Verilog, Inline Assembly in combination with the ATmega328PU microcontroller to simulate pulse width modulation with two motors, two buttons and an LED.

## Overview

Console Application that allows user to simulate regenerative energy power generation canada

## Function
User can press and hold one of two buttons, first will allow user to store and charge an energy variable whilst other will let user prematurely stop charge. 
Pulse Width Modulation is also shown and worked with
